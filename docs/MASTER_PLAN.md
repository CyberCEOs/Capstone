# Master Plan

# Capstone Project: Autonomous AI Warfare (Red vs. Blue)
**Project Lead:** Sam | **Status:** In Development

## 🎯 Executive Summary
This project demonstrates an autonomous cybersecurity conflict between two AI systems in a controlled "Small Scale" enterprise environment. 
1. **Red Team (Attacker):** A multi-agent system that autonomously reconnoiters, plans, and executes exploits against a target, specifically attempting to blind or evade the defensive AI.
2. **Blue Team (Defender):** An LLM-integrated SIEM (ZySec-7B + Wazuh) that monitors logs in real-time to detect, report, and eventually counter-act adversarial actions.

## 🏆 Core Objectives
1. **Agent-on-Agent Warfare:** Can the Red Team detect that a Blue Team AI is watching? Can it exploit the Blue Agent?
2. **Diminishing Returns:** Analyze where AI assistance shifts from "helpful" to "noise" for human analysts.
3. **Autonomous Operations:** Demonstrate a full kill-chain (Recon -> Exploit -> Reporting) with minimal human prompt intervention.

## 🏗 High-Level Topology
The environment is a hybrid setup bridged by a **Tailscale Mesh Network**.

* **Node A (Sam's M2 Mac):** * *Role:* The "Battleground" & "Brain".
    * *Hosts:* Red Team Agents (Python), Blue Team Brain (ZySec-7B), Wazuh Manager (Docker).
* **Node B (Mani's Proxmox):** * *Role:* The "Victim" (Enterprise).
    * *Hosts:* Ubuntu VM running Juice Shop (Target) and Wazuh Agent (Sensor).
* **Node C (Sam's iMac):** * *Role:* The "Observer".
    * *Hosts:* Central Dashboard visualizing the conflict.

## 📊 Success Metrics
* **Mean Time to Detect (MTTD):** Time delta between Red Team `exploit_start` and Blue Team `alert_log`.
* **Exploit Success Rate:** (Successful Shells / Vulnerabilities Found).
* **AI Hallucination Rate:** Frequency of False Positives generated by the Blue Team LLM.
